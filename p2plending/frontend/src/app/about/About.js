                <dd>- The P2P Library Exchange facilitates a way for Lenders to securely loan their books and other media to people who are interested in borrowing these books and other media. The local library along with it's staff provides a means to safely and securely accomplish this goal as shown in the following diagram. </dd>

                <dt>Current situation:</dt>
                <dd>- There are individuals and companies that have collections of books and other media that in many case are just "gathering dust". Meanwhile these books and 
                  media could enrich the lives and enjoyment of others.</dd>

                <dt>An opportunity to help:</dt>
                <dd>- We believe many individuals and companies will gladly share their collections given an easy and safe way to so. Individuals wishing to borrow these shared collections in turn desire an easy way to locate and borrow this shared media.</dd>

              <dt>How the P2P Library Lending system &rdquo;{ title }&rdquo; helps:</dt>
              <dd>- Lendo is a web accessible application that provides a way to bring collections to a library where library staff will record their receipt and deposit them into a secure repository. Items stored in the repository can then be searched via the web app and reserved for checkout. The library with it's staff provide a secure way to share books and other media and track the disposition of all media.</dd>
